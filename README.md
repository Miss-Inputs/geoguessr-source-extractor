Python module to extract the JavaScript source from GeoGuessr, format it, download it, and try and extract game data/references to API functions/etc from it.

Run it with python -m geoguessr_source_extractor {dir to save source to} {dir to extract things to} (you may want to use --help to see additional optons)

This is very rough around the edges, and also kind of naughty. The aim here is for GeoGuessr players to discover more about things which allow building nice tools to get stats or other useful things, and this should not be used for any other weird purpose.

Either way, this may stop working at any time.
